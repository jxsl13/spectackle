## B-01KYD1G9RAEHWTK3SW3ZH3YFWS the stale-binary hint fires on released and packaged binaries, where its advice cannot be followed

GitHub issue 29. This is a defect in the MCP-010 hint shipped by T-01KYB2318RFFGV6NA9WBWABMYB, found by field use of the released binary rather than by the development checkout it was built and tested in.

OBSERVED: every tool call prepends the hint naming make dev, including on a freshly installed release binary in a repository that contains no Makefile at all. The advice is unfollowable for anyone who installed spectackle rather than building it. It fires on every tool without exception.

WHY IT IS WORTH FIXING RATHER THAN TOLERATING, per the reporter: it sits on the token path of a server whose stated purpose is long-term token efficiency, costing a fixed tax on every result while carrying no information for the majority of users; and it trains callers to filter h lines wholesale, which is the same record class used for real signal such as commands op=detect reporting a detected harness. A noisy channel gets filtered, and the useful records go with it.

ROOT CAUSE IN OUR OWN TERMS: the check compares the executable's modification time against the newest source file under the workspace root. In a development checkout that is meaningful. For an installed binary the sources under the user's own repository are almost always newer, so the condition is permanently true and says nothing. The feature was verified only from the perspective it was written in.

FIX DIRECTION: fire only where the advice is actionable — a development checkout of spectackle itself, where a rebuild is both possible and relevant. The staleness check already stats the executable, so it has enough information to recognize that it is not running from a development build; consider also that the version stamp distinguishes a tagged release from a dev build.

VERIFY: an installed binary in an unrelated repository emits no hint on any tool; a development checkout with sources newer than the binary still emits exactly one per crossing; the existing debounce and once-per-crossing tests keep passing.
