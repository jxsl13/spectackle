## B-01KYFPNCK2E2QVSAF3QDS1W11S http CLI path silently drops SPECTACKLE_AGENT for identity-bound verdicts
kind: bug
state: draft
created: 2026-07-26
targets: cmd/spectackle/main.go, internal/mcpserver/validate.go

REPRO: SPECTACKLE_AGENT=cross-val-87zn spectackle call -http <addr> validate op=verdict records the verdict as the SERVER agent (dogfeed-orchestrator), while the same env on a -root direct call stamps correctly. OBSERVED during T-01KYD87ZN cross-verification: the independence evidence exists only in the findings text, not in the recorded identity. EXPECTED: identity-bound events (validate/grill verdicts) driven over -http must carry the caller identity - either forward SPECTACKLE_AGENT per call (header or input field) or refuse verdict ops over -http when the caller identity equals the item author, forcing the caller to pick a channel that records truthfully. Silent identity substitution is the defect: it fabricates independence. DESIGN NOTE: per-call agent field must not allow spoofing an arbitrary identity onto OTHER event kinds; scope it to verdict-bearing ops or sign it with the ephemeral-agent machinery (ag-[0-9a-f]{4}).

## T-01KYFPNCXEERJ90CB7STB4ZGVZ dup detector must ignore hunk context-only functions; unify short8/shortHash as its proof
kind: task
state: draft
created: 2026-07-26
grilled: 2026-07-26 open=0
targets: internal/mcpserver/validate.go, internal/evidence/dup.go, internal/mcpserver/tools.go

OBSERVED (T-01KYD87ZN validation): v dup go:mcpserver.short8 ~= go:mcpserver.shortHash 100% fired although BOTH functions predate the diff - short8 sat in hunk CONTEXT lines adjacent to inserted code, so the hunk-scoped extraction treated it as touched. RULE: a dup finding must implicate only functions with at least one ADDED line in the attributed diff; context-line-only functions are preexisting code the task never wrote. IMPLEMENTATION: when mapping diffHunks to functions in validateDups, track added-line ranges (+ lines only, not context) and intersect with function spans before lookup in the dup index. PROOF: unify short8 (tools.go, 8 chars) and shortHash (validate.go, 12 chars) into one parameterized helper as the cleanup this false positive pointed at, and add a regression test where a diff INSERTS code adjacent to one twin of a preexisting dup pair and validateDups stays silent, plus one where the diff ADDS a twin and it fires. Byte-budget neutral: no output-format change.
